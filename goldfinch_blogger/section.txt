OUTLINE
Title: An Investor's Guide to Private Credit

SECTION:
Describe how private credit compares with other well known asset classes, such as real estate,
VC, stocks, bonds. You can compare things like returns, volatility, access, and lockup.
Make sure to also insert how Goldfinch private credit is different on these dimensions (specifically we have low lockup, and our accessibility is high).
It would be great to put all of this in a table for the reader. Bring in data or at least some kind of chart if you can. This should be 100-200 words in length and the heading should be
"Private credit vs. the rest".
